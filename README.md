- Signature is uniquely tied to the message and private key.

### ✅ Signature Verification
- Paste the message, public key, and signature to verify authenticity.
- Confirms both **message integrity** and **sender authenticity**.
- Shows instant and detailed verification results.

### ⛓️ Blockchain Integration
- Store signed messages and digital signatures on a **blockchain ledger**.
- Ensures signatures remain immutable and tamper-proof.
- View transaction hash for traceability and transparency.

### 📱 Mobile Companion App
- Verify signatures on the go with a mobile-optimized companion app.
- Features QR code scanning for fast input.
- Clipboard support and blockchain verification on mobile.

### 📘 Educational Tools
- Learn how RSA and digital signatures work.
