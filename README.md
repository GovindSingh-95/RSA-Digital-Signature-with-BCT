## ✨ Features

### 🔑 RSA Key Generation
- Generate a pair of **public** and **private** keys using the RSA algorithm.
- Visual strength indicator to assess key quality.
- Copy and manage your keys securely within the app.

### 📝 Message Signing
- Sign any custom message using your **private key**.
- Uses **SHA-256** for message hashing before signature.
- Signature is uniquely tied to the message and private key.

### ✅ Signature Verification
- Paste the message, public key, and signature to verify authenticity.
- Confirms both **message integrity** and **sender authenticity**.
- Shows instant and detailed verification results.

### ⛓️ Blockchain Integration
- Store signed messages and digital signatures on a **blockchain ledger**.
- Ensures signatures remain immutable and tamper-proof.
- View transaction hash for traceability and transparency.

### 📱 Mobile Companion App
- Verify signatures on the go with a mobile-optimized companion app.
- Features QR code scanning for fast input.
- Clipboard support and blockchain verification on mobile.

### 📘 Educational Tools
- Learn how RSA and digital signatures work.
- Step-by-step visual explanations.
- Interactive signature visualization to enhance understanding.
